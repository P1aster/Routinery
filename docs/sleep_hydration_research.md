# Research Summary: Sleep Duration, Bedtime/Wake Time, and Hydration

## 1. Sleep Duration

### Key Findings

-   Adults function best with **7--9 hours of sleep per night**.
-   Sleeping **less than 6 hours** is associated with:
    -   poorer cognitive performance
    -   mood disturbances
    -   increased health risks
-   Sleeping **more than 9 hours regularly** is also linked in some
    studies to negative health outcomes.

### Interpretation

Optimal sleep duration for most adults lies in the **7--9 hour range**,
with both short and excessively long sleep linked to worse outcomes.

## 2. Bedtime and Wake-Up Time Consistency

### Key Findings

-   Regular sleep timing improves:
    -   cardiovascular health
    -   metabolic stability
    -   sleep efficiency
-   Irregular schedules increase risk of:
    -   hypertension
    -   cardiovascular disease
-   Small variations (30--60 minutes) in bedtime can negatively affect
    health markers.

### Interpretation

Consistency in bedtime and wake-up time may be **as important as total
sleep duration**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Hydration Amount (Daily Water Intake)

### Typical Evidence-Based Guidelines

-   Women: \~2.7 L/day (from beverages + food)
-   Men: \~3.7 L/day (from beverages + food)

### Effects of Hydration

-   Adequate hydration supports:
    -   cognitive performance
    -   attention
    -   mood regulation
-   Dehydration correlates with:
    -   fatigue
    -   reduced concentration
    -   poorer mental performance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Hydration and Sleep Relationship

### Daily Hydration

-   Proper hydration is associated with:
    -   better sleep quality
    -   longer sleep duration
    -   improved REM sleep patterns (in some studies)

### Evening Hydration Timing

-   High fluid intake close to bedtime can:
    -   reduce sleep efficiency
    -   increase nighttime awakenings
    -   reduce morning alertness

### Practical Implications

-   Distribute water intake across the day.
-   Limit large fluid intake within 1--2 hours before sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Integrated Evidence-Based Recommendations

### Sleep

-   Aim for **7--9 hours nightly**.
-   Maintain consistent sleep and wake times.

### Bedtime Routine

-   Fixed bedtime and wake-up time daily.
-   Align with natural circadian rhythm when possible.

### Hydration

-   Total daily intake: \~2--4 L depending on sex, body size, and
    activity level.
-   Drink steadily throughout the day.

### Hydration Before Bed

-   Avoid large drinks before sleep.
-   Prefer small sips if needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Overall Conclusion

Research consistently shows that: - Optimal sleep duration is critical
for physical and mental health. - Regular sleep timing is strongly
associated with better long-term outcomes. - Adequate hydration supports
cognition and sleep quality. - Timing of hydration (especially before
bedtime) influences sleep continuity.
